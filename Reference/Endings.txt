JOHNNY CAGE
-------------------------

THROUGH THE BATTLES OF LIFE OR
DEATH SITUATIONS FACED DURING
THE TOURNAMENT

JOHNNY CAGE LEARNS THE TRUE
IMPORTANCE OF HIS FIGHTING SKILLS.

HE ALSO REALIZES THE FULL
POTENTIAL OF THE TOURNAMENT.

----------

HE RETURNS TO HOLLYWOOD AFTER
DEFENDING HIS NEW TITLE AS GRAND
CHAMPION. CAGE GOES ON TO FILM
MORTAL KOMBAT: THE MOVIE
AND ITS MANY SUCCESSFUL SEQUELS

-------------------------
KANO
-------------------------

WITH THE DEFEAT OF GORO AND
SHANG TSUNG, KANO WILL BRING
HIS OWN BRAND OF TREACHERY TO
THE TOURNAMENT. HIS BLACK DRAGON
ORGANIZATION FORMS A MONOPOLY OVER
THE CONTEST.

------------

THAT BRINGS SHAME AND TORMENT
TO ALL THOSE INVOLVED.

THEIR REIGN WILL END IN
ANARCHY AND DEATH. IT WILL
RESULT IN THE FINAL DISMANTALING
OF THE TOURNAMENT AND THE 
BATTLE OF THE SANS.

-------------------------
RAIDEN
-------------------------

RAIDEN'S VICTORY COMES AS NO
SURPRISE TO HIM. HE WAS NEVER
IMPRESSED BY SHANG TSUNG'S 
INFERIOR SORCERY, GORO'S BRUTE
FORCE, OR THE CHALLENGE OF THE
OTHER CONTESTANTS. HE QUICKLY
BECOMES BORED WITH HIS MORTAL
COMPETITION

-------

AND SOON INVITES OTHER GODS TO
PARTICIPATE IN HIS CONTEST. THE
ENSUING BATTLES RAGE ON FOR
YEARS. AND THE WARS RESULT IN
OUR WORLD'S FINAL DESTRUCTION.
HAVE A NICE DAY.

-------------------------
LIU KANG
-------------------------

AFTER DEFEATING MIGHT GORO
AND PUTTING AN END TO SHANG
TSUNG'S RULE OVER THE TOURNAMENT,
KANG IS ABLE TO RETURN THE
CONTEST TO ITS RIGHTFULL HOSTS -

THE SHAOLIN TEMPLES. KANG'S
HEROICS WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED.

HE WILL CONTINUE THE TRADITIONS
OF THE SHAOLIN TEMPLES AND RESTORE
THE TRUE PRICE AND RESPECT OF THE 
ONCE GREAT TOURNAMENT.

-------------------------
SCORPION
-------------------------

MARKED FOR DEATH YEARS AGO BY THE
LIN KUEI, SCORPION WAS MURDERED
BY SUB-ZERO. HE LEFT BEHIND A 
WIFE AND CHILD IN HIS FORMER LIFE
BUT WAS ALLOWED TO RETURN AND 
AVENGE HIS DEATH.

----------

EVEN WITH SCORPION'S TRIUMPH
IN THE TOURNAMENT AND NEW
TITLE AS GRAND CHAMPION, THE
PRICE HE PAID WAS HIGH. HE
CAN NEVER AGAIN KNOW HIS
FAMILY AND MUST EXIST FOREVER
WITH HIS SECRET CURSE.

-------------------------
SUB-ZERO
-------------------------

AFTER RECEIVING THE TITLE OF
GRAND CHAMPION, SUB-ZERO
DISAPPEARS BACK INTO THE 
SHADOWS FROM WHICH HE CAME.
HIS ONLY GOAL IN THE
TOURNAMENT WAS...

------

THE ASSASSINATION OF SHANG
TSUNG. HE WAS PAID A LARGE
SUM OF MONEY BY ONE OF
TSUNG'S WEALTHY ENEMIES. WITH
HIS MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
SUB-ZERO WILL COLLECT HIS
FORTUNE AND RETIRE FROM
HIS DANGEROUS PROFESSION.

-------------------------
SONYA
-------------------------

CAPTURED BY SHANG TSUNG,
SONYA'S SPECIAL FORCES UNIT
WAS TAKEN HOSTAGE - THEIR
ONLY HOPE WAS THE TOURNAMENT.
SHANG TSUNG PROMISED TO
RELEASE THE ENTIRE TEAM...

---

ONLY IF SONYA COULD WIN
THE CONTEST.  HER VICTORY
NOT ONLY RELEASED HER UNIT -
BUT ALSO PUT AN END TO THE
BLACK DRAGON AND SHANG 
TSUNG'S POWERFUL GRIP ON
THE TOURNAMENT.

-------------------------
KASUMI
-------------------------

AFTER DEFEATING SHANG TSUNG,
KASUMI REALIZES HE WAS TRICKED
BY SHINNOCK INTO ENTERING THE
TOURNAMENT - ONLY TO ELIMINATE
THE EARTHREALMERS.

----

BACK IN THE NETHEREALM,
RAIDEN VOWS TO HELP KASUMI
DEFEAT SHINNOCK AND RETURN TO
THEIR MORTAL FORMS, HABAKI AND
SENZO.
